Plover: Open Source Stenography Software
========================================

Stenography expertise, original concept, feature design, and testing
by Mirabai Knight. Code and technical design by Joshua Harlan
Lifton. Additional code contributions by Hesky Fisher.

Supported stenotype protocols:
 * QWERTY keyboards with n-key rollover (e.g. Microsoft SideWinder X4)

 * TX Bolt (a.k.a. Gemini TX)
 * Stentura
 * Treal
 * Passport

Contact the authors if you would like Plover to support your stenotype
machine.

Why Use Plover?
 * For people who can't use their voice to speak but want to communicate in realtime
 * For people whose fluency of thought depends on ease and efficiency of text input
 * For people who want to avoid wasted effort and repetitive stress injuries
 * For people who want to input text and control their computers while walking around
 * For people who want to provide live verbatim transcription professionally
 * For people who have to be the fastest, no matter what

Warning
-------

Plover is not mature software. Once running, it will interpret all
keystrokes according to the stenography dictionary you provide. Be
careful what you type. When using the Sidewinder or any other normal
keyboard with Plover, your normal keyboard shortcuts may not work. Use
the mouse or stop the Plover program if you are unsure of what will
result from typing.

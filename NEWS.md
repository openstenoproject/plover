# v4.0.0.dev11 (2022-05-15)

## Features

### Core

- Switch to `plover_stroke` for better steno handling: faster and stricter. (#1362, #1417, #1452)
- New faster and improved RTF/CRE parser. (#1364, #1365)
- Correctly handle formatting currency with thousands separator(s): `23,000.15{:retro_currency:$c}` => `$23,000.15`. (#1391)
- Improve “English stenotype” system compatibility with RTF/CRE spec: support arbitrary placement of the number sign when parsing steno (e.g. `18#`, `#18`, and `1#8` are all valid and equivalent). (#1491)
- Improve translation stage: cut down on unnecessary / duplicate dictionary lookups. (#1513)

### User Interface

- Improve accessibility:
  - Disable tab-key navigation in tables, so focusing a table does not lock global tab-key navigation to it.
  - Remove some container widgets, tweak focus rules to avoid extra unnecessary steps when using tab-key navigation (like selecting the dictionaries widget outer frame).
  - In form layouts, link each widget to its label (like each option in the configuration dialog).
  - Set the accessible name / description of focusable widgets.
  - Use lists for the dictionaries widget, suggestions widget, and the paper tape. (#1308, #1332, #1434, #1451)
- Show a message when hiding to tray. (#1333)
- Improved steno handling:
  - validate inputs in the "add translation" dialog and dictionary editor
  - sort on steno order in the dictionary editor, and signal invalid steno entries (#1362, #1501)

### Linux

- Improve D-Bus logger implementation. (#1496)
- Add `WM_CLASS` property to windows (`WM_CLASS(STRING) = "plover", "Plover"`). (#1498)

## Bugfixes

### Core

- New reworked RTF/CRE support:
  - correctly handle multi-lines mappings
  - detect syntax errors (with recovery)
  - use `\n\n` for new paragraphs (instead of non-undoable `{#Return}{#Returns}`)
  - similarly, use `\t` and `\n` for `\tab` and `\line`
  - correctly escape `{}\` on save
  - use custom ignored groups for Plover macros and metas
  - use groups to improve round-tripping affixes (so there's no ambiguity when parsing back, e.g. `{^in^}fix` -> `{\cxds in \cxds}fix` instead of `\cxds in\cxds fix`) (#1364, #1365)
- Fixed a memory leak on reloading externally modified dictionaries. (#1375)
- Do not discard existing filters on dictionaries reload. (#1388)
- Fix engine's running state: make sure the translator' state is empty when enabling output for the first time. (#1504)
- Fix exit handlers not getting always executed. (#1507)
- Fix `StenoDictionaryCollection.longest_key` implementation: ignore disabled dictionaries! (#1512)

### User Interface

- Speedup dictionary editor startup (avoid duplicate sort). (#1351)
- Updated Spanish translation. (#1420)
- Updated French translation. (#1422)
- Speedup suggestions widget implementation: should noticeably improve performance when there's a large scrollback. (#1481)

### Windows

- Drop launch option from installer's final page: avoid possible issues (e.g. permission errors with the controller's pipe) because Plover was run as admin. (#1495)
- Fix notifications behavior: no persistent duplicated icons (one for each notification). (#1507, #1508)

## API

### Breaking Changes

- The custom `test` command implementation provided by `plover_build_utils.setup.Test` has been removed:
  - support for it on setuptools' side has been deprecated since version 41.5.0
  - the custom handling of arguments conflicts with the use of some pytest options (e.g. `-m MARKEXPR`)
  - the workaround for pytest cache handling is not necessary anymore (#1332)
- The `steno` helpers (`Stroke` class, `normalize_stroke`, …) now raise a `ValueError` exception in case of invalid steno. (#1362, #1501)
- The support for `StenoDictionary` and `StenoDictionaryCollection` longest key callbacks is gone, use the `longest_key` properties instead. (#1375)


# v4.0.0.dev10 (2021-06-19)

## Features

### Core

- Change behavior when launching Plover and an existing instance is already running: send a `focus` command to the existing instance (to show, raise, and focus the main window). Additionally, a new `plover_send_command` executable/script can be used to send other commands. (#1284)
- Add FreeBSD/OpenBSD support. (#1306)

### Linux

- The oldest Ubuntu LTS release supported by the AppImage is now Ubuntu Bionic (18.04). (#1329)

## Bugfixes

### Core

- Fix 2 corner cases when handling dictionaries:
  - If the class implementation is marked as read-only, then loading from a writable file should still result in a read-only dictionary.
  - Don't allow `clear` on a read-only dictionary. (#1302)
- Don't try to start missing extensions. (#1313)

### User Interface

- Correctly restore a window if it was minimized: fix the `focus` command, and activating a tool window. (#1314)

## API

### Breaking Changes

- The `Engine` constructor now takes an additional parameter: the controller. (#1284)

### New

- Add some new helpers to `plover_build_utils.testing`:
  - `dictionary_test`: torture tests for dictionary implementations.
  - `make_dict`: create a temporary dictionary.
  - `parametrize`: parametrize helper for tracking test data source line numbers. (#1302)


# v4.0.0.dev9 (2021-04-22)

## Features

### Core

- A new `SET_CONFIG` command can be used to change the configuration with a stroke, e.g.:
  ``` json
  "O*EP": "{PLOVER:SET_CONFIG:'translation_frame_opacity':100}",
  "TR*PB": "{PLOVER:SET_CONFIG:'translation_frame_opacity':0}",
  ```
  to change the opacity of the "Add Translation" dialog on the fly. (#989)
- Speed up loading dictionaries. (#1022)
- Be more restrictive with macro names: only accept valid identifier, so for example `==` is not handled like a macro anymore. (#1025)
- Ignore case when processing builtin commands / metas. (#1069)
- Add user friendly names for built-in metas, e.g.: `{:retro_case:cap_first_word}`, `{:retro_currency:$c}`, `{:attach:attach^}`, etc... (#1069)
- Improve orthography rules. (#1092, #1212)
- The configuration is now automatically saved on change, rather than on exit. (#1123)
- Add prefix strokes (syntax `/STROKE`) that will only translate if they are at the beginning of a word. Word endings can be specified with `{:word_end}` or `{$}`. (#1157)
- Add support for conditional formatting (based on the text following a translation): `{=REGEXP/TRANSLATION_IF_FOLLOWING_TEXT_MATCH/TRANSLATION_IF_NOT}` or `{:if_next_matches:REGEXP/TRANSLATION_IF_FOLLOWING_TEXT_MATCH/TRANSLATION_IF_NOT}`. (#1158)

### User Interface

- Add menu entry for opening the configuration directory ("File" =&gt; "Open config folder"). (#981)
- Automatically focus the input field and pre-select the previous input when the lookup window is activated. (#1009)
- Improve the configuration dialog for serial machines: automatically scan available ports and default to the first one. (#1036)
- The "Add translation" stroke lookup now returns entries for all enabled dictionaries and is debounced to improve performance. (#1084)
- Added translation into Spanish. (#1165)
- A new command, `{PLOVER:SUGGESTIONS}`, is available to open the suggestions window with a steno stroke. (#1184)
- Add support for saving dictionaries:
  - save a copy of each selected dictionary
  - merge the selected dictionaries into a new one
  - both operations support converting to another format (#1244)
- Added translation into Dutch. (#1264)
- Added Italian translation. (#1268)

### Linux

- The distribution Python is now built with optimization. (#1068)
- Expand the list of supported key names in key combos to include non-US specific keys (like `ISO_Level3_Shift`). (#1082)
- The default configuration directory on Linux is now `~/.config/plover` (`~/.local/share/plover` is still supported for backward compatibility). (#1123)

- Fix updating a dictionary mapping: ensure reverse lookups data stays consistent. (#1022)
- Fix keymap validation: properly fallback to default keymap when invalid. (#1065)
- Fix lookups by translation: do not ignore lower priority dictionaries when a match is found in a higher priority one. (#1066)
- Fix wordlist support for system plugins: try loading from the system dictionaries root (and not Plover assets directory). (#1116)
- Configuration save operations are now atomic. (#1123)
- Fix forced lowercasing of all engine command arguments. (#1139)
- Fix implicit hyphen handling with numbers only strokes on some theories (e.g. Melani). (#1159)

### New

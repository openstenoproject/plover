# In the TX Bolt protocol, there are four sets of keys grouped in
# order from left to right. Each byte represents all the keys that
# were pressed in that set. The first two bits indicate which set this
# byte represents. The next bits are set if the corresponding key was
# pressed for the stroke.

# 00XXXXXX 01XXXXXX 10XXXXXX 110XXXXX
#   HWPKTS   UE*OAR   GLBPRF    #ZDST

# The protocol uses variable length packets of one, two, three or four
# bytes. Only those bytes for which keys were pressed will be
# transmitted. The bytes arrive in order of the sets so it is clear
# when a new stroke starts. Also, if a key is pressed in an earlier
# set in one stroke and then a key is pressed only in a later set then
# there will be a zero byte to indicate that this is a new stroke. So,
# it is reliable to assume that a stroke ended when a lower set is
# seen. Additionally, if there is no activity then the machine will
# send a zero byte every few seconds.

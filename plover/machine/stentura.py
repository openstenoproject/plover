"""Thread-based monitoring of a stenotype machine using the stentura protocol.
"""

"""
The stentura protocol uses packets to communicate with the machine. A
request packet is sent to the machine and a response packet is received. If
no response is received after a one second timeout then the same packet
should be sent again. The machine may hold off on responding to a READC
packet for up to 500ms if there are no new strokes.

Each request packet should have a sequence number that is one higher than
the previously sent packet modulo 256. The response packet will have the
same sequence number. Each packet consists of a header followed by an
optional data section. All multibyte fields are little endian.

The request packet header is structured as follows:
- SOH: 1 byte. Always set to ASCII SOH (0x1).
- seq: 1 byte. The sequence number of this packet.
- length: 2 bytes. The total length of the packet, including the data
  section, in bytes.
- action: 2 bytes. The action requested. See actions below.
- p1: 2 bytes. Parameter 1. The values for the parameters depend on the
  action.
- p2: 2 bytes. Parameter 2.
- p3: 2 bytes. Parameter 3.
- p4: 2 bytes. Parameter 4.
- p5: 2 bytes. Parameter 5.
- checksum: 2 bytes. The CRC is computed over the packet from seq through
  p5. The specific CRC algorithm used is described above in the Crc class.

The request header can be followed by a data section. The meaning of the
data section depends on the action:
- data: variable length.
- crc: 2 bytes. A CRC over just the data section.

The response packet header is structured as follows:
- SOH: 1 byte. Always set to ASCII SOH (0x1).
- seq: 1 byte. The sequence number of the request packet.
- length: 2 bytes. The total length of the packet, including the data
  section, in bytes.
- action: 2 bytes. The action of the request packet.
- error: 2 bytes. The error code. Zero if no error.
- p1: 2 bytes. Parameter 1. The values of the parameters depend on the
  action.
- p2: 2 bytes. Parameter 2.
- checksum: 2 bytes. The CRC is computed over the packet from seq through
  p2.

The response header can be follows by a data section, whose meaning is
dependent on the action. The structure is the same as in request packets.

The stentura machine has a concept of drives and files. The first (and
possibly only) drive is called A. Each file consists of a set of one or
more blocks. Each block is 512 bytes long.

In addition to regular files, there is a realtime file whose name is
'REALTIME.000'. All strokes typed are appended to this file. Subsequent
reads from the realtime file ignore positional arguments and only return
all the strokes since the last read action. However, opening the file again
and reading from the beginning will result in all the same strokes being
read again. The only reliable way to jump to the end is to do a full,
sequential, read to the end before processing any strokes. I'm told that on
some machines sending a READC without an OPEN will just read from the
realtime file.

The contents of the files are a sequence of strokes. Each stroke consists
of four bytes. Each byte has the two most significant bytes set to one. The
rest of the byte is a bitmask indicating which keys were pressed during the
stroke. The format is as follows: 11^#STKP 11WHRAO* 11EUFRPB 11LGTSDZ ^ is
something called a stenomark. I'm not sure what that is. # is the number
bar.

Note: Only OPEN and READC are needed to get strokes as they are typed from
the realtime file.

Actions and their packets:

All unmentioned parameters should be zero and unless explicitly mentioned
the packet should have no data section.

RESET (0x14):
Unknown.

DISKSTATUS (0x7):
Unknown.
p1 is set to the ASCII value corresponding to the drive letter, e.g. 'A'.

GETDOS (0x18):
Returns the DOS filenames for the files in the requested drive.
p1 is set to the ASCII value corresponding to the drive letter, e.g. 'A'.
p2 is set to one to return the name of the realtime file (which is always
'REALTIME.000').
p3 controls which page to return, with 20 filenames per page.
The return packet contains a data section that is 512 bytes long. The first
bytes seems to be one. The filename for the first file starts at offset 32.
My guess would be that the other filenames would exist at a fixed offset of
24 bytes apart. So first filename is at 32, second is at 56, third at 80,
etc. There seems to be some meta data stored after the filename but I don't
know what it means.

DELETE (0x3):
Deletes the specified files. NOP on realtime file.
p1 is set to the ASCII value corresponding to the drive letter, e.g. 'A'.
The filename is specified in the data section.

OPEN (0xA):
Opens a file for reading. This action is sticky and causes this file to be
the current file for all following READC packets.
p1 is set to the ASCII value corresponding to the drive letter, e.g. 'A'.
The filename is specified in the data section.
I'm told that if there is an error opening the realtime file then no
strokes have been written yet.
TODO: Check that and implement workaround.

READC (0xB):
Reads characters from the currently opened file.
p1 is set to 1, I'm not sure why.
p3 is set to the maximum number of bytes to read but should probably be
512.
p4 is set to the block number.
p5 is set to the starting byte offset within the block.
It's possible that the machine will ignore the positional arguments to
READC when reading from the realtime file and just return successive values
for each call.
The response will have the number of bytes read in p1 (but the same is
deducible from the length). The data section will have the contents read
from the file.

CLOSE (0x2):
Closes the current file.
p1 is set to one, I don't know why.

TERM (0x15):
Unknown.

DIAG (0x19):
Unknown.

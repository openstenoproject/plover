"""Generic stenography data models and translation engine.

This module is the foundation for manipulating and understanding the
output of a stenotype machine. Three classes copmose this module:

Stroke -- A data model class that encapsulates a sequence of steno
keys, which might be ASCII or raw binary data, in the context of a
particular normalized dictionary format, essentially abstracting away
the details of a particular stenotype machine's formatting.

Translation -- A data model class that encapsulates a sequence of
Stroke objects in the context of a particular dictionary. The
dictionary in question maps stroke sequences to strings, which are
typically English words or phrases, but could also be meta commands.

Translator -- A state machine that takes in a single Stroke object at
a time and emits one or more Translation objects based on a greedy
conversion algorithm.

class Translator :

    An instance of this class serves as a state machine for processing
    key presses as they come off a stenotype machine. Key presses
    arrive in batches, each batch representing a single stenotype
    chord. The Translator class packages each chord as a Stroke and
    adds the Stroke to an internal, length-limited FIFO, which is then
    translated into a sequence of Translation objects. The resulting
    sequence of Translations is compared to those previously emitted
    by the state machine and a sequence of new Translations (some
    corrections and some new) is emitted.

    The internal Stroke FIFO is translated in a greedy fashion; the
    Translator finds a translation for the longest sequence of Strokes
    that starts with the oldest Stroke in the FIFO before moving on to
    newer Strokes that haven't yet been translated. In practical
    terms, this means that corrections are needed for cases in which a
    Translation comprises two or more Strokes, at least the first of
    which is a valid Translation in and of itself.

    For example, consider the case in which the first Stroke can be
    translated as 'cat'. In this case, a Translation object
    representing 'cat' will be emitted as soon as the Stroke is
    processed by the Translator. If the next Stroke is such that
    combined with the first they form 'catalogue', then the Translator
    will first issue a correction for the initial 'cat' Translation
    and then issue a new Translation for 'catalogue'.

    A Translator takes steno key input via the consume_steno_keys
    method and provides translation output to every function that has
    registered via the add_callback method.

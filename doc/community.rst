Steno Community
===============

There are many places where you can meet the stenography community. As Plover,
we are focused on the Open Steno Project's various outlets, but there are also
classic closed steno resources online.

Open Steno Project
------------------

  * |discord|_: Join the Discord server to chat with other steno-interested
    individuals. We welcome new people who may have very basic questions,
    looking for direction and help. We also welcome curious developers,
    stenography students, intermediate stenos, and professionals who are
    curious about Plover and its many uses compared with traditional software.
    Feel free also to drop by if you are looking to practice or find a new
    brief.

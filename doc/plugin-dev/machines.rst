Machines
========

To define a new machine called ``Example Machine``, add the name as an entry
point to your ``setup.py``:

.. code-block:: ini

    [options.entry_points]
    plover.machine =
      Example Machine = plover_my_plugin.machine:ExampleMachine

Machines are implemented as **classes** that inherit from one of a few machine
classes. The example shown uses the
:class:`ThreadedStenotypeBase<plover.machine.base.ThreadedStenotypeBase>` class
as it is the most common use case, but you can build machine plugins off of the
:class:`StenotypeBase<plover.machine.base.StenotypeBase>`,
:class:`SerialStenotypeBase<plover.machine.base.SerialStenotypeBase>`, or other
classes depending on your needs.

.. highlight:: python

::

    # plover_my_plugin/machine.py

    from plover.machine.base import ThreadedStenotypeBase

    class ExampleMachine(ThreadedStenotypeBase):
      KEYS_LAYOUT: str = '0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10'
   
      def __init__(self, params):
        super().__init__()
        self._params = params

      def run(self):
        self._ready()
        while not self.finished.wait(1):
          self._notify(self.keymap.keys_to_actions(['1']))

      def start_capture(self):
        super().start_capture()

      def stop_capture(self):
        super().stop_capture()

      @classmethod
      def get_option_info(cls):
        pass

The ``_notify`` method should be called whenever a stroke is received. It takes
a set of key names in the current system (it's possible to convert from machine
key names to system key names (actions) with ``self.keymap.keys_to_actions``
function) and then tells the steno engine the key input that just occurred.

There are 3 ways to configure the keymap:

  * Add an entry for the machine in a system plugin's default bindings
    definition (``KEYMAPS`` variable)
  * The user can manually set the keymap in the Machine section in the
    configuration, along with any other additional configuration if a
    machine_option plugin is available for the machine type
  * Define a class variable ``KEYMAP_MACHINE_TYPE``, which means that the
    default configuration is the same as the default configuration of the
    specified machine.

See :doc:`/api/machine` for more information.

Machine Options
---------------

If your machine requires additional configuration options, add a machine
options entry point:

.. code-block:: ini

    [options.entry_points]
    plover.gui_qt.machine_options =
      plover_my_plugin.machine:ExampleMachine = plover_my_plugin.machine:ExampleMachineOption

Machine options plugins are implemented as Qt widget **classes**:

::

    # plover_my_plugin/machine.py

    from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QWidget

    class ExampleMachineOption(QWidget):
      def setValue(self, value):
        pass

The process for developing these is similar to that for :doc:`gui_tools`.
See :ref:`qt_machine_options` for more information.

    - implementing protocols
    - Qt UI for machine options

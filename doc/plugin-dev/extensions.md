# Extensions

Extension plugins are implemented as **classes**. The initializer should take
only a {class}`StenoEngine<plover.engine.StenoEngine>` as a parameter.

```ini
[options.entry_points]
plover.extension =
  example_extension = plover_my_plugin.extension:Extension
```

```python
# plover_my_plugin/extension.py

class Extension:
  def __init__(self, engine):
    # Called once to initialize an instance which lives until Plover exits.
    pass

  def start(self):
    # Called to start the extension or when the user enables the extension.
    # It can be used to start a new thread for example.
    pass

  def stop(self):
    # Called when Plover exits or the user disables the extension.
    pass
```

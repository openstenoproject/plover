Dictionaries
============

To define a dictionary format with the file extension ``.abc``, add this name
(without the ``.``) as an entry point:

.. code-block:: ini

    [options.entry_points]
    plover.dictionary =
      abc = plover_my_plugin.dictionary:ExampleDictionary

Dictionary plugins are implemented as **classes** inheriting from
:class:`StenoDictionary<plover.steno_dictionary.StenoDictionary>`. Override the
``_load`` and ``_save`` methods *at least* to provide functionality to read and
write your desired dictionary format.

.. highlight:: python

::

    # plover_my_plugin/dictionary.py

    from plover.steno_dictionary import StenoDictionary

    class ExampleDictionary(StenoDictionary):

      def _load(self, filename):
        # If you are not maintaining your own state format, self.update is usually
        # called here to add strokes / definitions to the dictionary state.
        pass

      def _save(self, filename):
        pass

Some dictionary formats, such as Python dictionaries, may require implementing
other parts of the class as well. See the documentation for
:class:`StenoDictionary<plover.steno_dictionary.StenoDictionary>` for more
information.

Note that setting ``readonly`` to ``True`` on your dictionary class will make
it so the user is not able to modify a dictionary of that type in the UI.

    - dictionary loading/saving code
    - programmatic dictionary formats

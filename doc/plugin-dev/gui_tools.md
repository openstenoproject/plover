# GUI Tools

Plugins containing GUI tools will also require modifying the `setup.py`
as follows:

```python
from setuptools import setup
from plover_build_utils.setup import BuildPy, BuildUi

BuildPy.build_dependencies.append("build_ui")
BuildUi.hooks = ["plover_build_utils.pyqt:fix_icons"]
CMDCLASS = {
  "build_py": BuildPy,
  "build_ui": BuildUi,
}

setup(cmdclass=CMDCLASS)
```

By making these changes, you get commands to generate Python files from your
Qt Designer UI and resource files:

    python3 setup.py build_py build_ui

In addition, create a file named `MANIFEST.in` in your plugin directory as
follows. Change the paths as needed, but make sure to only include the Qt
Designer `.ui` files and resources, and not the generated Python files.

    exclude plover_my_plugin/tool/*_rc.py
    exclude plover_my_plugin/tool/*_ui.py
    include plover_my_plugin/tool/*.ui
    recursive-include plover_my_plugin/tool/resources *

```ini
[options.entry_points]
plover.gui.qt.tool =
  example_tool = plover_my_plugin.tool:Main
```

GUI tools are implemented as Qt widget **classes** inheriting from
{class}`Tool<plover.gui_qt.tool.Tool>`:

```python
# plover_my_plugin/tool.py

from plover.gui_qt.tool import Tool

# You will also want to import / inherit for your Python class generated by
# your .ui file if you are using Qt Designer for creating your UI rather
# than only from code
class Main(Tool):
  TITLE = 'Example Tool'
  ICON = ''
  ROLE = 'example_tool'

  def __init__(self, engine):
    super().__init__(engine)
    # If you are inheriting from your .ui generated class, also call
    # self.setupUi(self) before any additional setup code
```

Keep in mind that when you need to make changes to the UI, you will need to
generate new Python files.

See the documentation on {class}`Tool<plover.gui_qt.tool.Tool>` for more
information.

Just like extension plugins, GUI tools can interact with the engine through the
{class}`StenoEngine<plover.engine.StenoEngine>` API, but instead of using
{ref}`engine hooks<engine-hooks>` directly, GUI tools should use Qt's
signals mechanism. Plover's {class}`Engine<plover.gui_qt.Engine>` class
provides Qt signals to be used as hooks.

```python
class StrokeLogger(Tool, Ui_StrokeLogger):
  def __init__(self, engine):
    super().__init__(engine)
    self.setupUi(self)

    # Instead of engine.hook_connect
    engine.signal_connect("stroked", self.on_stroked)

  def on_stroked(self, stroke):
    pass
```

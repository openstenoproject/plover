# `plover.registry` -- Plugin registry

```{py:module} plover.registry
```

The Plover registry collects plugins from the local Python environment via
the [`entry_points`](https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setuptools.html#dynamic-discovery-of-services-and-plugins)
mechanism. This module exposes an interface to access the
list of available plugins, as well as possibly adding new ones.

```{data} registry
A global instance of the Plover registry, initialized by Plover
at startup.
```

````{class} Registry([suppress_errors=True])
```{data} PLUGIN_TYPES
:type: Tuple[str]

A tuple of valid plugin types, such as `machine` for machine plugins
and `gui.qt.tool` for GUI tools.
```

```{method} list_plugins(plugin_type: str) -> List[Plugin]
Returns a list of available plugins of the specified type. `plugin_type`
should be in {data}`PLUGIN_TYPES`, otherwise this raises a `KeyError`.
```

```{method} get_plugin(plugin_type: str, plugin_name: str) -> Plugin
Returns a {class}`Plugin` object containing information about the plugin
with the specified name, of the specified type. `plugin_type` is
case-sensitive, but `plugin_name` is not. Raises a `KeyError` if such
a plugin could not be found.
```

```{method} update()
Re-scans the Python environment to look for plugins, and registers any
that were previously not loaded.
```

```{method} register_plugin_from_entrypoint(plugin_type: str, entrypoint: pkg_resources.EntryPoint)
Adds a plugin of the specified type discovered through the entry point
mechanism to the registry.
```

```{method} register_plugin(plugin_type: str, name: str, obj: any)
Adds a plugin named `name` of the specified type to the registry.
`obj` is the Python object that provides the functionality of the
plugin, and could be a function, class, or module -- the exact type
depends on the type of plugin (see {doc}`../plugin_dev` for more information).

If `plugin_type` is not a valid plugin type (i.e. not in {data}`PLUGIN_TYPES`),
this raises a `KeyError`.
```

```{method} list_distributions() -> List[PluginDistribution]
Returns the list of distributions that Plover has found to contain
Plover plugins. If {meth}`update` has not been called, this will
return an empty list.
```
````

````{class} Plugin(plugin_type, name, obj)
```{attribute} plugin_type
:type: str

The type of the plugin. This will be one of {data}`PLUGIN_TYPES<Registry.PLUGIN_TYPES>`.
```

```{attribute} name
:type: str

The name of the plugin. This will be the same as the entrypoint name
provided when creating a plugin.
```

```{attribute} obj
The Python object providing the plugin's functionality, could be a
function, class, or module.
```
````

````{class} PluginDistribution(dist, plugins)
```{attribute} dist
:type: pkg_resources.Distribution

A [`Distribution`](https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pkg_resources.html#distribution-objects)
providing information on a single package either
bundled with Plover, or installed from the plugins manager, for
example, the main Plover package `plover 4.0.0-dev10`. Each
distribution may contain multiple plugins.
```

```{attribute} plugins
:type: List[Plugin]

The list of plugins contained in this distribution.
```

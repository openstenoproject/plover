# `plover.oslayer.keyboardcontrol` -- Keyboard control

```{py:module} plover.oslayer.keyboardcontrol
```

This module handles platform-specific operations relating to the keyboard,
both for capturing keyboard input (using the keyboard to write steno) and
keyboard emulation (writing the output from steno translation).

````{class} KeyboardCapture
Encapsulates logic for capturing keyboard input. An instance of this is
used internally by Plover's built-in keyboard plugin.

Define the {meth}`key_down` and {meth}`key_up` methods below to implement
custom behavior that gets executed when a key is pressed or released.

```{data} SUPPORTED_KEYS_LAYOUT
:type: str

A human-readable text representation of the layout of keys on the
keyboard. This is the same across platforms.
```

```{data} SUPPORTED_KEYS
:type: Tuple[str]

A tuple containing the list of individual keys from
{data}`SUPPORTED_KEYS_LAYOUT`.
```

```{method} suppress_keyboard([suppressed_keys: List[str] = ()])
Suppresses the specified keys, preventing them from returning any
output through regular typing. This allows us to intercept keyboard
events when using keyboard input.
```

```{method} key_down(key: str)
A custom method that is called when a key is pressed. `key` is a string
representing the name of the key, and must be in {data}`SUPPORTED_KEYS`.
Does nothing by default.
```

```{method} key_up(key: str)
A custom method that is called when a key is released. `key` is a string
representing the name of the key, and must be in {data}`SUPPORTED_KEYS`.
Does nothing by default.
```

````{class} KeyboardEmulation

Encapsulates logic for sending keystrokes. Pass an instance of this to
the {class}`StenoEngine<plover.engine.StenoEngine>` when it is initialized.

```{method} send_backspaces(number_of_backspaces: int)
Sends the specified number of backspace keys.
```

```{method} send_string(s: str)
Sends the sequence of keys that would produce the specified string.
```

```{method} send_key_combination(combo_string: str)
Sends the specified key combination. `combo_string` is a string in the
key combo format described in {mod}`plover.key_combo`.
```

Plover and Professional Stenography
===================================

Why does Plover exist?
----------------------

Falling numbers of graduates from steno schools and the high attrition of
retiring stenographers initially caused `Mirabai Knight <http://stenoknight.com/>`_
to worry about the future of her profession, as inferior non-verbatim systems
(e.g., ER, Typewell, C-Print, automated speech recognition) threaten to fill
in the supply vacuum caused by a shortage of steno professionals.

At the same time, she saw steno's great potential in helping to improve the
lives of the large number of people who work in front of computers all day,
whether they're writing prose, creating software, entering data, or
communicating in text with friends and coworkers. As a method of text entry,
QWERTY is inefficient and unergonomic, but so far it hasn't been supplanted by
any of the competing systems (such as
`Dvorak <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_Simplified_Keyboard>`_ or
`Colemak <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyboard_layout#Colemak>`_), because
they're simply not powerful enough to justify the time investment necessary
to learn them. Steno, on the other hand, is.

So Plover has a double-pronged approach:

  1.  Find people who want to learn steno, whether just as amateurs or as
      aspiring professionals, and give them a cheap, simple, and fun way to
      try it out.

  2.  Then, for those few who find that they've got both a gift and a passion
      for steno, provide an opportunity to turn that skill into a career,
      feeding the talent pools for future professional stenographers and
      ensuring that steno as a profession will survive into the future.

Why does steno need amateurs?
-----------------------------

In most skill-based fields -- music, photography, athletics, and computer
programming, to name a few -- a healthy pool of amateurs makes it possible for
professionals to exist. People cultivate an interest, buy some cheap equipment,
take a few classes, discover that they love the work, hone their skills with
thousands of hours of practice, and eventually a very dedicated and talented
few are able to become good enough to make a living at what they love. The
rest do it without compensation, just for their own pleasure and enjoyment.
This is the natural ecosystem of any difficult skill: A wide base of dabblers
and dilettantes at the bottom, and a small number of world class hotshots at
the top.

Without a steady supply of amateurs to hold the ranks, it's difficult for
professionals to exist. Many legendary musicians started out with a $50 guitar
and a tattered songbook. If every guitar cost $5,000 and the only way to learn
how to play it was at a conservatory, how many potentially great guitarists
would never even get within strumming range? Plover reduces the $1,500+ initial
startup cost of steno to around $70, which means vastly more people can give it
a try and see if it might be for them.

What is Steno Arcade?

`Steno Arcade <http://store.steampowered.com/app/449000/>`_ is a suite of
arcade games designed to teach and drill steno fundamentals in an immersive,
addictive, responsive, and interactive way.

Is Steno Arcade going to put steno schools out of business?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Very unlikely. There will always be a place for high-speed dictation and
one-on-one interaction between steno professionals and students. Steno Arcade
will be directed at people who want to use steno non-professionally, aren't
sure whether steno is for them, or who want to try it out a bit before
committing to making it a definite career goal.

There will always be some autodidacts who can get through the Steno Arcade
program entirely by themselves and find themselves certification-ready at the
end of it, but that will probably be fairly rare.

Is Plover going to put CAT software companies out of business?
--------------------------------------------------------------

Definitely not. Plover is not court reporting software. It has no transcript
preparation utilities of any kind. However, it might prove useful to people
who use other CAT systems for their work but would like to use Plover as a
replacement for their QWERTY keyboard in daily computing tasks. At some point
Plover might become a solid option for CART providers, but there are no plans
to make it into CAT replacement software for either court reporters or
broadcast captioners.

What are some features in Plover not commonly found in most CAT software?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

  1.  Plover's main purpose is to replace the QWERTY keyboard with a steno
      keyboard. Unlike other CAT systems, it does not have a text entry window;
      it's a pure conduit straight to the operating system. Anything you can do
      with a QWERTY keyboard can be done with Plover, and you can use it with
      the word processor or text editor of your choice.

  2.  Plover runs on Windows, Mac, and Linux.

  3.  Its length-based buffer, as opposed to the time-based buffer used in most
      CAT software, ensures instant delivery of text with no buffer flushing or
      time delay.

  4.  Its dictionary is text-based, so you can search through and edit it using
      any text editor. `Updating the dictionary from the writer is smooth and
      seamless <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSU5JlVXT1A>`_.

  5.  And, of course, its biggest feature: It's 100% free and open source. You
      can download it, keep it on a USB key, and have it to hand as a backup in
      case something happens to your CAT software. You can distribute it to
      interested friends and potential steno students. You can run it on as
      many computers as you like, with absolutely no restrictions. And, if you
      know how to program in Python, you can modify it and change it to your
      heart's delight.

Which steno machines are compatible with Plover?
------------------------------------------------

See the :doc:`hardware_guide`. In summary, Plover supports many common steno
machines that you may own, but critically also supports using a regular
computer keyboard and mapping a subset of its keys to the steno layout.

This lets users try out stenography without needing to purchase a steno machine!

What theory is Plover's default dictionary based on?
----------------------------------------------------

It's basically Mirabai Knight's personal dictionary, which is a mix of
New York Career Institute theory and StenEd, with several thousand tweaks,
briefs, and additions of her own. Plover works with dictionaries in RTF/CRE
format, exportable from just about any CAT software.
